Reversi
=======

This is a Reversi game for the C class. The project ended on the 20/05/2012, so
this repository is now open.

Usage
-----

- Compiling: `make`
- Playing: `./othello --play`

Use these commands to play:
- `affiche` : print the board
- `coups` : print possible moves
- `newgame` : new game
- `score` : print the current player's score

To make a move, the command has 3 chars: The first is the name of the current
player (B for White (*Blanc* in French), and N for Black (*Noir* in French)).
The next two chars are `PA` if the player wants to pass his turn, or a square
name (e.g. `B6`, `H2`). For example, if the current player is White and wants to
play in C3, type:
    
    BC3

The program responds with "OK" if the move is ok, "ERREUR â€¦" if there is an
error.
